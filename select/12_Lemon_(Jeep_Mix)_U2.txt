Lemon
See through in the sunlight
She wore lemon
But never in the daylight

She's gonna make you cry
She's gonna make you whisper and moan
And when you're dry
She draws her water from the stone

And I feel
Like I'm slowly, slowly,
Slowly slipping under
And I feel
Like I'm holding onto nothing

She wore lemon
To color in the cold grey night
She had heaven
And she held on so tight

A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close

A man captures color
A man likes to stare
He turns his money into light
To look for her

And I feel
Like I'm drifting, drifting,
Drifting from the shore
And I feel
Like I'm swimming out to her

Midnight is where the day begins

A man builds a city
With banks and cathedrals
A man melts the sand so he can

See the world outside

A man makes a car
And builds a road to run them on
A man dreams of leaving

You're gonna meet her there
She's your destination
You gotta get to her
She's imagination

But he always stays behind

And these are the days
When our work has come asunder
And these are the days
When we look to each other

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins.
